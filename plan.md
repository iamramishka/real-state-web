## 1. Project Overview

**Website purpose.** A premium, conversion-focused real estate landing site that helps people discover, evaluate, and enquire about homes to **buy, sell, or rent**, and connect with agents — with an AI-style natural-language search experience at its core.

**Target users.**
- Home buyers browsing premium/luxury listings.
- Sellers evaluating "the smarter way to sell."
- Renters searching by lifestyle ("near a good school").
- Buyers/sellers looking for a trusted agent.
- Readers of real-estate news, trends, and tips.

**Business goal.** Generate qualified leads (search, save-search, contact-agent, sell-enquiry) and establish brand authority through editorial content. Primary KPI: contact/enquiry conversion; secondary: search engagement and return visits.

**Main pages (MVP).**
- `/` Home (all 15 sections below)
- `/buy`, `/rent`, `/sell` (filtered listing experiences)
- `/agents` (agent directory) and `/agents/[slug]`
- `/news` (articles index) and `/news/[slug]`
- `/property/[slug]` (listing detail)
- `/contact`
- System: `not-found`, `error`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`

**Main features.**
- AI-style search bar with Buy/Sell/Rent modes and conversational suggestion chips.
- Featured homes, "Homes for you," explore grid with filter chips.
- Property listing + interactive map split view.
- Smarter-way-to-sell feature band; neighborhood discovery; agent directory.
- Real estate news + trends/tips/inspiration editorial grids.
- Lead capture: contact form, save-search, sell-enquiry (validated, accessible).

**Goals by dimension.**
- **UX:** ≤2 clicks to a relevant listing; obvious primary action per section; no dead ends; clear loading/empty/error states.
- **UI:** premium, whitespace-heavy, consistent tokens; image-forward; calm monochrome palette + one restrained accent.
- **Performance:** Lighthouse ≥ 90 mobile; LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms; route JS budget < 200KB gzip on Home.
- **SEO:** semantic structure, per-route metadata, OpenGraph, JSON-LD (`RealEstateListing`, `Organization`, `BreadcrumbList`), sitemap/robots.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA; full keyboard operability; visible focus; labelled controls; contrast ≥ 4.5:1.
- **Security:** no secrets in client; safe external links; validated forms; CSP/security headers; audited deps.
- **Responsive:** mobile-first; verified on all 8 breakpoints (§6); no horizontal scroll; touch targets ≥ 44px.

**Expected final experience.** A fast, elegant, trustworthy site where a visitor lands, immediately understands they can search naturally, explores beautiful listings on any device, and is gently guided to enquire — feeling the brand is premium and credible.

**Main website sections** (detailed in §15): Header/Navbar · Hero (luxury image) · AI-style search bar · Suggested search chips · Buy/Sell/Rent + category filters · Explore homes · Featured homes · Homes for you · Property listing + map · Smarter way to sell · Neighborhood discovery · Agent section · Real estate news · Trends/tips/inspiration · CTA · Footer.

**What each top-level item is for**
- `plan.md` — coordination master (this file).
- `CLAUDE.md` / `CODEX.md` — non-negotiable working rules for each AI.
- `.claude/` `.codex/` — per-agent workspace notes and conventions.
- `claude/tasks.md` `codex/tasks.md` — the task queues each agent pulls from.
- `agents/` — one file per role with ownership boundaries and done criteria.
- `audits/` — repeatable checklists run before merges/release.
- `docs/` — durable references (design system, worktrees, rules, QA).
- Build-phase folders — implementation, owned by Codex (see §3 note and §7).

---

## 4. Claude & Codex Setup

**Roles.**
- **Claude** — planning, architecture, documentation, design system, UX copy, review/QA checklist generation, audit definitions. *Does not write production code unless a task explicitly assigns it.*
- **Codex** — project setup, component/page/styling/responsive implementation, unit tests, refactors, bug fixes, performance/security fixes, build verification. *Does not change planning strategy without approval.*

**Instruction files.**
- Global: `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md` (root). Read first, every session.
- Workspace: `.claude/README.md`, `.codex/README.md` (how each agent operates).
- Queues: `/claude/tasks.md`, `/codex/tasks.md` (what to do, with ownership + verification).
- Per-role: `/agents/*.md` (boundaries and done criteria).
- Reviews/audits: `/audits/*.md` (gates before merge/release).

**Hard rules.**
1. Claude and Codex must **never edit the same file in the same task**.
2. **Every task declares file ownership** (allowed + forbidden paths).
3. **Every task declares verification commands** (lint/test/build/etc.).
4. **Every task is independently executable** on its own branch/worktree.
5. Handoffs include: files touched · commands run · test result · next step.

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Role Allocation

Full definitions live in `/agents/*.md`. Summary (each file specifies Responsibility · Required skills · Allowed files/folders · Forbidden files/folders · Inputs · Outputs · Done criteria · Verification checklist):

## 7. Claude vs Codex Task Allocation

**Claude tasks:** project architecture planning · design-system planning · component planning · page/section breakdown · UX copywriting · documentation · agent instructions · review-checklist creation · audit-checklist creation · QA-plan creation · security planning · SEO planning · accessibility planning.

**Codex tasks:** project setup · component implementation · page implementation · styling implementation · responsive implementation · unit tests · refactoring · bug fixes · performance improvement · security fixes · build verification.

**Rules.**
- Claude must not implement production code unless explicitly assigned.
- Codex must not change planning strategy without approval.
- Never edit the same file in the same task.
- Every file has exactly **one active owner**.
- All handoffs include files touched, commands run, test result, next step.

---

## 8. GitHub Worktree Method

Full commands in `docs/worktree-strategy.md`. Summary:

**Branches.** `main` (protected, releasable) · `dev` (integration) · `feature/*` (work) · `review/*` · `merge/*`.
Examples: `feature/claude-design-system`, `feature/codex-header-hero`, `feature/codex-property-cards`, `review/ui-review`, `merge/release-prep`.

**Worktrees (live outside the repo root):**
`../worktrees/claude-design` · `../worktrees/codex-frontend` · `../worktrees/review` · `../worktrees/merge`.

**Core commands.**
```bash
# create a feature worktree on a new branch
git worktree add ../worktrees/codex-frontend -b feature/codex-header-hero dev

# list / status
git worktree list
git -C ../worktrees/codex-frontend status

# switch work = just cd into that worktree path
cd ../worktrees/codex-frontend

# integrate (no fast-forward to keep history)
git switch dev && git merge --no-ff feature/codex-header-hero

# remove a finished worktree + delete branch
git worktree remove ../worktrees/codex-frontend
git branch -d feature/codex-header-hero
git worktree prune
```

**Conflict-prevention rules.** One owner per branch; Claude and Codex use *separate* worktrees; never two branches editing the same file concurrently; rebase/merge `dev` before opening a PR.

---

## 9. GitHub Reviewer & Merger Review

**Reviewer — Claude.** Reviews every PR: code quality · security · accessibility · responsiveness · SEO · performance · design consistency · folder structure · coding rules · test results. Leaves comments, produces a review report, identifies risks, requests changes from Codex when needed. Does not edit implementation directly.

**Merger Review Agent — Claude.** Once all review comments are resolved and all 12 gates pass, Claude confirms: gates green · no file-ownership conflict · no unresolved comments · build passes · then **performs the merge** (`feature/* → dev`, and `dev → main` for releases). No human approval required in the merge loop.

**Merge flow:**
1. Codex opens PR (`feature/*` → `dev`).
2. Claude reviews → requests changes if needed → Codex fixes.
3. All gates green → Claude merges `feature/*` into `dev`.
4. After final release audit passes → Claude merges `dev` into `main` and pushes.

---

## 10. AI Verification System (12 Gates)

Each gate: **Purpose · Required evidence · Pass · Fail · Owner · Commands/checks.**

1. **Comprehension Gate** — Purpose: agent restates task + ownership. Evidence: written restatement + file list. Pass: matches task; no forbidden paths. Fail: ambiguity/scope creep. Owner: PM. Check: review handoff note.
2. **Planning Gate** — Purpose: approach agreed before code. Evidence: short plan + files to touch. Pass: approved. Fail: missing verification/ownership. Owner: Architect.
3. **File Ownership Gate** — Purpose: no collisions. Evidence: `git worktree list`, changed-files diff. Pass: only owned files changed. Fail: touches another owner's files. Owner: Worktree Controller. Check: `git diff --name-only dev...HEAD`.
4. **Design Consistency Gate** — Purpose: tokens/components reused. Evidence: screenshots + token references. Pass: matches `design-system.md`. Fail: ad-hoc styles. Owner: UI/UX.
5. **Code Quality Gate** — Evidence: lint+typecheck logs. Pass: 0 errors. Fail: any error/ignored rule. Owner: Reviewer. Check: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`.
6. **Responsive Gate** — Evidence: captures at all 8 breakpoints. Pass: no overflow, usable. Fail: broken layout/horizontal scroll. Owner: QA. Check: Playwright viewport runs.
7. **Accessibility Gate** — Evidence: axe report + keyboard walkthrough. Pass: 0 serious/critical, AA contrast. Fail: violations. Owner: A11y Auditor. Check: `npm run test:a11y`.
8. **SEO Gate** — Evidence: metadata + JSON-LD + sitemap. Pass: per-route metadata valid. Fail: missing tags. Owner: SEO Auditor. Check: build + Lighthouse SEO.
9. **Test Gate** — Evidence: unit + e2e results. Pass: all green, meaningful coverage. Fail: failures/skips. Owner: QA. Check: `npm run test && npm run test:e2e`.
10. **Security Gate** — Evidence: `npm audit` + secret scan + XSS review. Pass: no high/critical, no secrets. Fail: any. Owner: Security Scanner. Check: `npm audit --audit-level=high && gitleaks detect`.
11. **Performance Gate** — Evidence: Lighthouse + bundle report. Pass: ≥90, budgets met. Fail: regressions. Owner: Perf Auditor. Check: `npm run lighthouse && npm run analyze`.
12. **Final Merge Gate** — Evidence: all gates green + reviewer approval. Pass: merger recommends. Fail: any open item. Owner: Merger Review.

## 11. Quality Standards

Clean code · reusable components · small focused files · consistent naming · organized folders · responsive design · accessibility · SEO · performance · security · maintainability · purposeful comments · robust error handling · explicit loading states · explicit empty states · validated forms · optimized images · design consistency · content consistency · cross-browser support. (Enforced via `docs/development-rules.md` + audits.)

---

## 12. Coding Rules

- No large/messy files; keep components small and focused (target < ~200 lines).
- Consistent naming; avoid duplicated UI logic; use reusable data arrays.
- Semantic HTML; accessible labels; `alt` on every image.
- No hardcoded repeated content; no unnecessary dependencies.
- Never expose secrets; never commit `.env`.
- Don't edit generated lock files unless required.
- Run checks before every commit; don't bypass lint; don't ignore TS errors.
- No `console.log` in production; no unsafe HTML (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) unless reviewed.
- Don't break mobile layout; no low-quality images.

---

## 13. Things to Avoid

Copying the reference layout exactly · editing another agent's files · mixing Claude/Codex tasks · starting code before reading `plan.md` · large unreviewed changes · skipping tests · skipping security checks · ignoring mobile/a11y/SEO · low-quality placeholder images · breaking design consistency · fake backend when not needed · overengineering · unnecessary packages · hiding failed checks · deleting files without approval.

## 16. Security & AI Security Scanning

**Checks:** dependency audit · secret scanning · input validation · XSS prevention · safe external links · image-source safety · form validation · env-var rules · package-trust review · AI-generated-code security review · pre-merge security checklist.

**Rules:** never expose API keys · never commit `.env` · never trust user input · avoid unsafe HTML injection · validate forms (Zod) · safe external links (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`, restricted `target`) · review all third-party packages · run security audit before merge. Details in `docs/security-rules.md` + `audits/security-audit.md`.

## 17. Audits

Run from `/audits/`: UI · Responsive · Accessibility · SEO · Performance · Security · Code Quality · Final Release. Each lists What to check · How · Responsible agent · Required evidence · Pass/fail. Audits map to the gates in §10 and must pass before the Final Merge Gate.

## 18. Accountability System

Track every task in this table format (mirrored in the queues).
Statuses: `todo` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `approved` → `merged` (or `blocked`).

## 19. How to Work With Me

- Ask before major design changes.
- Show the file plan before editing.
- Explain what will change and why.
- Give short progress updates.
- Provide exact commands to run.
- Report errors clearly; never hide failed checks.
- Ask confirmation before deleting files or large refactors.
- Always end with the next step.
- Do not start implementation before planning approval.

---

## 20. Final Support Files

Created alongside this plan (see §21 for removal policy):
`CLAUDE.md` · `CODEX.md` · `.claude/README.md` · `.codex/README.md` · `claude/tasks.md` · `codex/tasks.md` · `agents/{project-manager,architect,ui-ux-designer,software-engineer,component-engineer,data-content-engineer,qa-engineer,github-worktree-controller,github-reviewer,merger-review,security-scanner,performance-auditor,accessibility-auditor,seo-auditor,documentation-agent}.md` · `audits/{ui,responsive,security,performance,accessibility,seo,code-quality,final-release}-audit.md` · `docs/{design-system,worktree-strategy,development-rules,security-rules,responsive-rules,qa-checklist}.md`.

---

## 21. Safe To Remove plan.md Later

`plan.md` is the master coordination document during setup — **do not delete it early.**

It may be removed **only when all** of the following are true:
- All permanent instruction files (§20) are created and verified non-empty.
- All important information from `plan.md` has been copied into the correct permanent files (overview→README/docs; rules→development/security/responsive rules; agents→`/agents`; audits→`/audits`; design→`design-system.md`).
- The **Project Manager Agent** and **Merger Review Agent** both approve removal.
- It is **not** removed during early development.

Until then, treat `plan.md` as the single source of truth.

---

## 22. Final Response Format

When planning output is delivered, provide: (1) list of files created, (2) how Claude should start, (3) how Codex should start, (4) first 5 development tasks, (5) commands to run next, (6) risks/missing requirements. **Do not build the website until planning files are complete and approved.**
